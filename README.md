HamsterTracker
==============
A generalised tracking app
 
Concept and Features
--------------

This website enables users to track whichever subjects they would like to. Users are able to create a new tracking subject (eg Hamster Health), add attributes they will track (eg weight, food given, coat shinyness), and choose ranges and types for those attributes (eg integers from 1 - 5, floats greater than 0). 

They can then make entries in this subject and view those entries on a graph against time. Coupled with the table of correlations that automatically displays on the page, this makes the relationship between each of the attributes and how they have changed over time obvious.
